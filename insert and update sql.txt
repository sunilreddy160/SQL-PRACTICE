in  SQL, the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements are used to modify data in a table. Here are examples of how each of these statements is used:

1. INSERT Statement:
The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table.

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

-- Example
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 50000);


2. UPDATE Statement:
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table.
Syntax 
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

-- Example
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 55000.00
WHERE employee_id = 1;


3. DELETE Statement:
The DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table based on a specified condition.
-- Syntax for deleting rows 
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- Example
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id = 1;
