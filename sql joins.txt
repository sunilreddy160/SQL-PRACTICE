The SQL JOIN statement is used to combine rows from two tables based on a common column and selects records that have matching values in these columns.
SELECT columns_from_both_tables
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.column1 = table2.column2
Here,

table1 and table2 are the two tables that are to be joined
column1 is the column in table1 that is related to column2 in table2
LEFT JOIN:
Retrieves all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
RIGHT JOIN :
Retrieves all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
Syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

FULL JOIN :

Retrieves all rows from both tables, with NULL values in columns where there is no match.
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
